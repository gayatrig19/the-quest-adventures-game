  the program.
- As a user, I want the navigation to be intuitive and easy to understand.
- As a user, I want to have an option to start the game.
- As a user, I want to be able to enter my name before I start to play the game.
- As a user, I would like to see a welcome message and my name added to storyline for more engaging
  experience.
- As a user, I want my input to be validated and error checked each time, so I can re-enter my
  input/choice if it is invalid.
- As a user, I should not have to worry about capitalizing or lowercase when typing.
- As a user I want the storyline and narrative to be coherent, engaging and well structured.
- As a user, I want to receive the next part in the story depending on the input choices.
- As a user, I want to reach the end of the game through one of the paths chosen, by either
  succeeding or failing in the game.

  outcomes.
- As a user, I want to be presented with choices throughout the game that allow me to choose my path
  based on story scenarios.

## Design

### Data Model

While implementing the project in Python, my primary focus was to incorporate Object Oriented Programming(OOP) Paradigms as the project necessity is functionality-centered. The mechanics, interactions, and story progression are implemented using text-based input and output. During discussion with my mentor, he guided me on how I can use data structures for storyline instead of opting for text-based iteration to keep code well-structured and organized utilising "Don't Repeat Yourself"(DRY) principle.

- Classes: I have used a single TreasureQuest Class containing story_description(dictionary)
  attribute and methods to initialize the game instance for the text-based adventure game using that  dictionary, encapsulating the game's functionality and story.

- Dictionaries: The story_description dictionary contains the game's storyline, choices, and outcomes
  structured as follows:
     - Keys: Strings representing different steps in the game.
     - Values: Dictionaries containing:
          1. "step_text": Text describing the current step.
          2. "options" (Dictionary): Available choices and their corresponding steps.
          3. "outcome": Outcome of the current step ("success" or "failure").

- Functions: To keep code readable and reusable, functions(play_game, display_intro, start_game,
  get_user_input) are  used to display the game's introduction and loop through the game's story, displaying text, options, and handle user choices, leading to different outcomes. 

- Input Validation: Each user input is validated and handled raising appropriate error depending on
  game stage and option to re-enter user input is provided if it is invalid.

- Separation of Concerns: Separated the game logic from the data(storyline) and the presentation
  (text-based input and output) to follow a good design practice and keep code well-maintained.

- The game defines various locations and sublocations, and the player can navigate through these  
  areas based on their choices. The game uses text-based print statements to provide descriptions, dialogues, and narrations to convey the story and set more engaging atmosphere.

### Flowchart

- Most of the text-based adventure games are primarily focused on providing user(player) with multiple
  paths and choices to explore before reaching to its' final outcome(either success or failure).

- The initial design for this project was simple with minimal paths with single nodes leading to win
   or lose outcomes. But I wanted the game to be more engaging such that players are presented with choices at various points in the game, and these choices lead to different story paths and outcomes.

- To achieve this the flowchart was redesigned number of times, and each time the story was modified
  for expected paths and choices until the point where it offered multiple endings, depending on the decisions the player makes throughout the game. These endings can vary in terms of success, failure and different story conclusions.

- The final flowchart design now showcase multiple paths with more engaging story narrative, offering 
  multiple success and failure outcomes. Though the end result is either success or failure, but based on the user choices, the game has different paths and scenarios to reach the end.

- For each step, the users receives a prompt to write their input, and the input is cross-checked
  against the code for validation. If the user input is invalid, they are given error feedback and prompted again to input on the same step. Once valid input is received, the user goes on to the next step.

- Regardless of the outcomes, user is provided option to play again, which either starts the game from
  beginning or exits depending on user choice.

- Below is the final flowchart design which can be followed to see all alternatives and their final
  outcomes.

# Features

## Existing Features

### Welcome Screen

- The main game title in ASCII text Art and a welcome message is shown when user hits the run program
  button. The welcome message is given a typewriter effect for a more game-immersive experience.
- User is provided with an overview about the game and a general idea on how to play the game.
- As it is a Python terminal based game, it is designed to be functionality-focused rather than 
  visually appealing. The structure though is designed keeping in mind the aspects of the game.

  ![welcome_screen_image](assets/welcome_screen_image.png)


### Start Game Section

- Here user is prompted whether he wants to start the game, based on choices the game proceeds. If
  user has entered 'no' he is encouraged to play the game by providing a suitable feedback.
- The user can add their name to give them a personalised welcome to the game. The user's name is
  further used in the game story for providing player with a more personalized experience.

![start_game_image](assets/start_game_image.png)


### Game Steps Section

- The user is then taken through a story with different scenarios and locations with detailed
  explanation of the journey and provided choices for the user to choose from which path they want to take. Choosing different paths can lead to different outcomes.

- Each story step is detailed and well-structured to give user an engaging adventure experience.


![start_story_step](assets/play_game_image_step.png)


- The storyline is designed to keep each step interconnected and user is provided with two options to 
  choose from, based on the user choice the game paths can result in different outcomes. 


![story_steps](assets/play_game_image.png)


### Success and Failure Outcomes

- Based on user choices, there are multiple paths which can lead to either success or failure
  outcomes.
- The game is designed in such a way that user can explore multiple scenarios and locations based
  upon the choices resulting in either of the result.
- At the end of the user's journey, they are presented with a final text depending on their success or
  failure in the quest.

   - Success Text for the quest:
     
     ![success_outcome_image](assets/success_outcome_image.png)

   - Failure Text for the quest:
     
     ![failure_outcome_image](assets/fail_outcome_image.png)


- At the end, regardless of success or failure user is offered to play the game again. Based on the
  choice, the game either starts from the beginning or exits with a message.

## Future Implementations 
 
- To fix the identified bugs in the game.
- Add colours to text and imagery for visual effect.
- Expand the story for mutilpe levels(easy, medium and difficult) to give user more deep and
   immersive game experience.
- Use of google doc/ sheet to keep track of the number of players, their win and lose outcomes, a 
  form of leaderboard to display at the end of the game. This will give me opportunity to work with google spreadsheets to perform CRUD operations.



## Testing

- Note: This game will not work on mobiles as it runs on the mock terminal. (credit: Mock terminal created by Code Institute). No accessibilty or responsivity testing was therefore needed.

### Validator Testing

 - Python code is tested using Code Institute PYTHON LINTER, with no errors. Code passed through and  
   confirmed no problems.  

  - validated run.py file:
     
     ![run_validator_testing](assets/python_validation_runpy_file.png)

  
  - validated story.py file:

    ![story_validator_testing](assets/python_validation_storypy_file.png)



### Manual Testing:

- I tested the site in my local terminal and Code Institute Heroku Terminal.
- For user testing, I passed the application link to my friends and family and received positive 
  feedback, with some points to fix.

- Input Validation:

The application is tested extensively for input validation. I have manually tested it by doing 
following:

1. Proceed further with no input or input incorrect character/number for "Are you ready to play the 
   game" prompt.
     
    - Response: Receive an error message and prompt "Are you ready to play the game"(yes/no) again.

    
    ![start_game_input_validation](assets/start_game_input_validation.png)


2. Input username with less than 3 characters/ containing special characters/ proceed without 
   entering one.  
  
    - Response: Error message is displayed based on the user action and a prompt to enter user name.


    ![username_input_validation](assets/username_input_validation.png)


3. Input incorrect choice other than 1 and 2 for "Enter your choice" prompt while playing the game  
   for different paths.

    - Response: Error message is displayed for invalid choice and user is prompted to enter the 
                choice again.


    ![play_game_input_validation](assets/play_game_input_validation.png)        


4. At the end of the game, input incorrect character/ number/ press 'enter' with no input given for 
  "Would you like to play again" prompt.

    - Response: Receive an error message and prompt to enter the choice(yes/no) again.

### Functional Testing:

Functional testing for user stories is as follows:

1. Expected: As a user, I want to understand the purpose and intention of the site and application  
   when I run the program.
    - Result: When user clicks on run program, the title in ASCII art and a welcome message with
              general idea and rules is displayed.

2. Expected: As a user, I want the navigation to be intuitive and easy to understand.
    - Result: The user is provided with easy to understand options and choices to navigate throughout
              the game.

3. Expected: As a user, I want to have an option to start the game.
             As a user, I should not have to worry about capitalizing or lowercase when typing.
    - Result: User is prompted with option for starting the game. Input by user(uppercase and
              lowercase) is handled as required correctly.

4. Expected: As a user, I want to be able to enter my name before I start to play the game.
             I would like to see a welcome message and my name added to storyline for more engaging
             experience.
    - Result: User is prompted to enter name which is further used in welcome message and storyline
              for personalized experience.

5. Expected: As a user, I want my input to be validated and error checked each time, so I can 
             re-enter my input/choice if it is invalid.
    - Result: Input validation is carried out at each step where user input is required and error 
              message is displayed if it is invalid prompting user to re-enter the input/choice.

6. Expected: As a user, I want to receive the next part in the story depending on the input choices.
             As a user, I want see the final outcome of the game based on the choices made.
    - Result: User is taken further to next part of the game depending on the choices and paths taken.
              and provided with final text(success or failure) at the end of the game.

7. Expected: As a user, I want to have an opportunity to play again regardless of success or failure 
             in the game.
    - Result: At the end of the game, user is given an option to play again, based on user choices,
              the game exits or start from beginning.

8. User can explore different paths and scenarios with engaging story during the game, for multiple 
   success and failure outcomes.


### Unfixed Bugs

There is one unfortunate bug that hasn't been resolved. I have used typewriter effect for displaying some parts of my game story text. During final stages of testing, a bug was discovered where the user can interfere with the game text while typewriter effect is printing which results in altering of the main storyline text. I was not able to trail any solution for the bug. During discussion with my mentor, he did come up with a solution. I wanted to study the solution code first before using it in my project, but with no time in hand, I decided to keep it unresolved as it is not breaking the underlying code.
