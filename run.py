                captain, Captain Blackbeard, centuries ago. The treasure is said to be     
                unimaginable, with jewels that glitter like stars and riches beyond       
                measure.\n
                You are Captain Alex Sterling, a seasoned sailor and fearless leader      
                known for your daring voyages across treacherous seas. The lure of the

                Option 1: Do you navigate the Enchanted Forest, where magic fills the     
                          air and mythical creatures roam?                                          
                Option 2: Or do you brave the treacherous Mountains of Shadows, where     
                          the secrets of the Scepter may be concealed among the rugged 
                          peaks?
